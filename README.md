Data Driven Web Development for KCTCS Students

These projects will provide some base reference material for you to observe Django/Python in action from the most very basic standpoint of web development.

The "mydjango" project is currently the only one that has been built to any significance. Use this as a reference resource to understand how one might perform specific actions. In this example, we mock up a rudementry example of a blog posting mechanism that 
provides the most based CRUD mechanisms.

As basic as it is, it provides many examples of how you might perform similar tasks in your own projects. There are many ways of doing the same thing in programming and this is just the method chosen for this course.

If you have questions, please reach out in the classroom!
